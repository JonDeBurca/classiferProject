# classiferProject
Creating a model to correctly classify images

The data contains processed product images of sneakers and ankle boots from Zalando.com. Every row consists of a label, being either 0 for a sneaker or 1 for an ankle boot, and 28x28 8-bit grayscale pixel values of the product image. The goal of this project is to evaluate and optimise the performance of different classifiers for their suitability to classify this dataset.

This project compared a perceptron model with a support vector machine model using k fold cross validation to measure performance.
